# Methodology

The project followed an iterative development approach inspired by Lean Startup principles, based on continuous **Build–Measure–Learn** cycles. This allowed the prototype to evolve progressively while validating decisions through experimentation and feedback.

The methodology was organized into five main phases:

1. **Exploration & Requirements**  
   Understanding the operational context through discussions and analysis of the call-center workflow and information needs.

2. **Prototype Construction**  
   Designing and implementing an initial pipeline for call transcription, analysis, and structured information extraction using automated workflows and AI-based processing.

3. **Validation**  
   Testing the prototype with real and simulated recordings to evaluate output consistency, analytical relevance, and system behavior.

4. **Iteration & Improvement**  
   Refining prompts, workflow configuration, and data outputs based on evaluation results and stakeholder feedback.

5. **Visualization & Interpretation**  
   Structuring results into dashboards and reports to enable institutional teams to analyze trends, detect recurring issues, and support decision-making.

This iterative methodology ensured that the solution remained aligned with operational needs while progressively improving analytical accuracy and usability.
